# LICIT-ROBOTS.TXT

LICIT-ROBOTS.TXT is an alphabetically ordered whitelisting of legitimate web robots, which obey the Robots Exclusion Standard (robots.txt). 

Each bot is shortly described in a comment above the (list of) user-agent(s). Uncomment or delete bots (User-agents) you do not wish to allow on your website / which you do not need to visit your website.

## Files

There are two versions of LICIT-ROBOTS.TXT.

1. The regular file (inlc. comments)  
   `robots.txt`
2. The minified file (no comments)  
   `robots.min.txt`

If you use the minified version, do not forget to rename it to `robots.txt` to be affective.
